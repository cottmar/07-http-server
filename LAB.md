## Feature Tasks
For this assignment you will be building a HTTP server.
#### Server Module
The server module is responsible for creating an http server defining all route behavior and exporting an interface for starting and stopping the server. It should export an object with `start` and `stop` methods. The start and stop methods should each return a promise that resolves on success and rejects on error.
###### GET / - default
When a client makes a GET request to / the server should send back html with a project description and an anchor to /cowsay.
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> cowsay </title>
  </head>
  <body>
   <header>
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="/cowsay">cowsay</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
   <header>
   <main>
     <!-- project description -->
   </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

###### GET /cowsay?text={message}
When a client makes a GET request to /cowsay?text={message} the server should parse the querystring for a text key. It should then send a rendered HTML page with a cowsay cow speaking the value of the text query. If their is no text query the cow message should be a random string taken from the `Faker` package.
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> cowsay </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1> cowsay </h1>
    <pre>
      <!-- cowsay.say({text: req.query.text}) -->
    </pre>
  </body>
</html>
```

###### GET /api/cowsay?text={message}
When a client makes a POST request to /api/cowsay it should send JSON that includes `{"text": "<message>"}`. The server should respond with a JSON body `{"content": "<cowsay cow>"}`.

A response for a valid Requests should have a status code of 200 and the JSON body
``` json
{
  "content": "<cowsay cow text>"
}
```

A response for a invalid Requests should have a status code of 400 and the JSON body...
```
{
  "error": "invalid request: text query required"
}
```

###### POST /api/cowsay
When a client makes a POST request to /api/cowsay it should send JSON that includes `{"text": "<message>"}`. The server should respond with a JSON body `{"content": "<cowsay cow>"}`.

| Request | Response Status Code | Response Type | Response Body |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| With out a body | 400 | JSON | `{"error": "invalid request: body required"}` |
| With out text property on the body | 400 | JSON | `{"error": "invalid request: text query required"}` |
| With text query | 200 | JSON | `{"content": "<cowsay cow text>"}` |


## HTTPie commands
* `http GET :3000/pathname text=="judy vue"`
* `http POST :3000/pathname name=vincio`


## Cow Variatons
 * Design and implement a feature to change the cowfile on GET /cowsay, GET /api/cowsay, and POST /api/cowsay - **ex: dragon, sheep, etc**
   * You can find the different type of animals cowsay supports at https://github.com/piuccio/cowsay/tree/master/cows
* This is a design task. You neeed decide how to change your code structure implement the feature.
